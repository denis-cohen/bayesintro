## Abstract

Bayesian methods for inference and prediction have become widespread in the social sciences (and beyond). Over the last decades, applied Bayesian modeling has evolved from a niche methodology with high computational and software-specific entry barriers to a readily available toolbox that virtually everyone can use by running pre-implemented packages in standard statistical software on generic PCs. Although Bayesian methods are now more accessible than ever before, aspiring Bayesian practitioners may be overwhelmed by questions and choices - including, but not limited to, when and why to use Bayesian methods in applied research, how to implement and interpret Bayesian analyses, or which software to use.
 
This workshop is designed to help participants take these first steps. It juxtaposes frequentist and Bayesian approaches to estimation and inference, highlights the distinct characteristics and advantages of Bayesian methods, and introduces participants to the Bayesian workflow and applied modeling using the R package brms - an accessible interface to the probabilistic programming language Stan, which allows users to perform Bayesian inference with state-of-the-art algorithms by running little more than a few lines of code in R.


## Prerequisites

Working knowledge of the software environment `R` as well as working
knowledge of (generalized) linear models is required for participation
in this course.

This workshop requires installations of recent versions of [`R`](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html), [`RStudio`](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download), as well as the packages [`rstan`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rstan/index.html), [`brms`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/brms/index.html) (which depends on `rstan`), and [`marginaleffects`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/marginaleffects/index.html).

Setting up `rstan` can be somewhat time-consuming as it requires the installation of a free-of-charge C++ compiler. Before the workshop, participants should follow [these
instructions](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started) on the Stan Development Team's GitHub to install and configure the `rstan` package and its prerequisites on their operating system. If you do not have administrator privileges on your machine, please approach your system administrator in advance of the workshop. Should you encounter problems, feel free to send me an email.

## Using the workshop materials

### Interactive workshop materials

The workshop materials come as [`learnr`](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/) tutorials wrapped in an R package. To download, install, and use the interactive materials, run the following code:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Detach if loaded
if ("bayesintro" %in% (.packages())) {
  detach(package:bayesintro, unload = TRUE)
}

# Uninstall if installed
if ("bayesintro" %in% installed.packages()) {
  remove.packages("bayesintro")
}

# Install if not installed
if (!("devtools" %in% installed.packages())) {
  install.packages("devtools")
}

# Load from GitHub
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("denis-cohen/bayesintro")

# Load to library
library(bayesintro)

# Run tutorials (one at a time)
learnr::run_tutorial("00-00-int", package = "bayesintro")
learnr::run_tutorial("01-01-lec", package = "bayesintro")
learnr::run_tutorial("01-02-lec", package = "bayesintro")
learnr::run_tutorial("01-03-lab", package = "bayesintro")
learnr::run_tutorial("02-01-lec", package = "bayesintro")
learnr::run_tutorial("02-02-lec", package = "bayesintro")
learnr::run_tutorial("02-03-lab", package = "bayesintro")
```

### Static workshop materials

- You can find static PDF versions of the lecture slides in the folder `lecture-materials`.
- If you prefer working on the **lab exercises** outside of the interactive `learnr` environment (i.e., in a regular R session), you can use the `Rmd` files supplied in the folder `lab-materials`. These contains both exercises and solutions.
