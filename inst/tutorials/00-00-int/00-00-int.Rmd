## Introductions

### Hi, I'm Denis

- Senior Research Fellow, Data and Methods Unit, MZES
- Dr. phil. (political science), Humboldt University of Berlin (2018)
- I work on:
    - political consequences of spatial inequalities and residential mobility
    - party competition
    - voting behavior
    - quantitative social science (both pedagogical and methodological)

## Introduction to Bayesian Statistics

###  Learning Objectives

1. Contrast frequentist and Bayesian inference paradigms
1. Understand when and why researchers go Bayesian
1. Understand the basics of analytical and (especially) numerical Bayesian inference
1. Understand the costs and benefits of doing applied Bayesian data analysis
1. Perform applied Bayesian data analysis using the R package `brms` (Bayesian Regression Models using 'Stan')

### The end goal

Empower you to 

- implement
- execute 
- process
- scrutinize
- understand

Bayesian data analysis using pre-implemented tools.

### Advanced Bayesian Statistical Modeling Using R and Stan

This course's older sibling will take place May 6-8, 2024, in the GESIS Training Programme.

The key differences in terms of focus:

- Stronger focus on statistical modeling
- Focus on building, as opposed to using models

The key differences in terms of prerequisites and technicality:

- Stronger focus on the mathematical foundations of probability distributions
- Stronger focus on programming, incl. linear algebra
- Stronger focus on the Stan language, as opposed to the `brms` front-end

### A quick note on mathematical notation

- The teaching materials for this course use mathematical notation
- It is helpful, albeit not strictly necessary that you understand it:
    - Mathematical notation is a compact and universal tool to convey concepts...
    - ...but what really matters is that you understand the intuition of the underlying concepts...
    - ...and you will not be asked to translate formulas into code.
- If anything is unclear: Please ask at any time!

### Structure of our sessions

1. Lecture:
    - Input
    - Dedicated Q&A (but feel free to ask for clarification at any point!)
2. Lab: Hands-on exercises (in small teams)
    - You will be assigned to small teams in breakout rooms
    - I will be in the main meeting, available for questions
    - We will jointly discuss your answers and the solutions in the main meeting

### Session 3.1: Implementing a small data project using brms

- Becoming an active Bayesian practitioner requires practice!
- The challenges you may encounter along the way will likely be idiosyncratic
- Therefore, Session 3.1 gives you the chance to implement the Bayesian workflow using your own data
- This can be an analysis you are about to run for the first time or a replication of your existing work, as long as:
    - Pre-processing is complete: Your data is ready to go for data analysis
    - Neither your data nor your model are highly complex (if they are: start with a small subset of the data, gradually build up model complexity)
- I will be available for questions throughout Session 3.1
- We will jointly discuss your experiences and the main challenges you encountered at the start of Session 3.2

### RStan/brms installation: Any problems?

Did you successfully get RStan to run on your machine, incl. `example(stan_model, package = "rstan", run.dontrun = TRUE) `?

- If yes: Great! You're all set!
- If no: No worries, we will start using `brms` *tomorrow*. I will stick around after 15:15 today in case you need assistance.
